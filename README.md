# DIY SoundBox

This DIY soundbox can play a random sound of your choice when pressing a button. Electronics are based around a JQ8400, in my case controlled by an ESP8266 and powered using a single LiPo with TP4056, a step up module and some transistors to keep everything turned off as long as no sound is played.
